# Recipes App

## Justifications
- **Data Loading:** Used the `http` package to fetch data from an API.
- **UI Implementation:** Displayed recipes in a list using Flutter's `ListView` and `ListTile`.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented error handling to show messages if data loading fails.
- **State Management:** Utilized BLoC for state management to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Testing Strategies
- **Unit Tests:** Wrote unit tests for the `Recipe` model and `RecipeService` to ensure data parsing and fetching are correct.
- **Widget Tests:** Wrote widget tests to ensure `RecipeListScreen` displays correctly and handles loading states.
